Breathing field condensates emerging from maximal chaos.

# Chaos to Quarks 🌌🛡️

A simulation of the breathing relational field stabilizing into matter from maximal chaos.

---

## ✨ Overview
This project simulates the emergence of breathing condensates (proto-quarks) from full relational chaos:

- Random initial breathing fields across 300 points.
- Extreme relational coupling and breathing tensions.
- Rapid stabilization of breathing order within 10–15 time units.

---

## 🧠 Key Results
- ✅ Breathing condensates form under maximal chaos.
- ✅ Relational breathing fields self-organize into structure.
- ✅ First simulated glimpse of proto-matter breathing birth.
